_this was originally posted on [cohost](https://cohost.org/esaevian/post/200981-lastpass-on-android). follow me over there if you like_

first off, having a password manager and randomized passwords is good, do it.

but also lastpass on android is an exercise is frustration as the prompt to autofill only seems to pop up:

1. when I focus on the password field (so it doesnt work on sites that have two steps for logging in, unless I want to type my username/email if I can remember which I used) and, more egregiously:
2. the popup shows up for about 0.2 seconds.

first, this introduces cumulative layout shift, and when the prompt disappears i repeatedly click "submit" and try to log in with an empty form. 

second, i dont have those kind of reflexes, folks.

I don't do android development so I have no idea how hard this is to make consistent, or know any viable solution. this is just a complainy chost.
